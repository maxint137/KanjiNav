KanjiNav
=======

KanjiNav is an attempt to graphically represent the words and kanji for the JLPTs.
I'd like to start it as a local/static project. Then if the idea makes sense it will be possible to extend the project adding dynamic, user-specific attributes. Ideally it will work with Anki just as well.
